# Predicting-Taxi-Tip-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML
Say we are driving a taxi, Uber, or Lift and want to figure out how much tip you would get for a ride. 
So I have created an AI model to do just that.
i hvae used Scikit-learn and Snap ML, a high-performance IBM library for Machine Learning to build Decision Tree Regressor models.
I have done followings steps in this project :
1: Performed basic data preprocessing using Scikit-learn.
2: Model a regression task using Scikit-learn and Snap ML Python APIs.
3: Train a Decision Tree Regressor model using Scikit-learn and Snap ML.
4: Run inference and assess the quality of the trained models.
